# ADVENTURE-WORKS: Azure Data Engineering End-to-End Project

## Overview  
This project showcases an end-to-end **data engineering pipeline** utilizing Azure services. The pipeline includes **data ingestion, transformation, storage, and serving** using key Azure components.

## Pipeline Flow  
The following steps define the complete data flow:  
1. **Data Source**: Fetch raw data from the above uploaded csv files.  
2. **Data Ingestion**: Use **Azure Data Factory** to bring data into the system.  
3. **Data Transformation**: Process and refine the data for analytical use.  
4. **Storage**: Store transformed data in **Azure Data Lake Gen2**.  
5. **Serving**: Make processed data available for applications via Azure services.

## Azure Services Used  
- **Azure Data Factory** – Automates data ingestion  
- **Azure Data Lake Gen2** – Stores transformed data securely  
- **Azure Data Processing** – Transforms ingested data into structured formats  
- **Azure Serving Layer** – Delivers processed data to applications/users

## Features  
✅ **Scalable & Automated**: Azure Data Factory ensures seamless automation.  
✅ **Optimized Data Storage**: Azure Data Lake Gen2 efficiently handles large datasets.  
✅ **Secure & Reliable**: Implements Azure best practices for data security.  

## Setup Instructions  
1. **Create Azure Data Factory** for ingestion workflows.  
2. **Define Transformation Rules** based on required data structure.  
3. **Store Data in Azure Data Lake Gen2** for efficient access.  
4. **Configure Serving Layer** for applications or analytics platforms.
